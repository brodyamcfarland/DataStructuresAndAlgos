//If you know solution is not far from the root:
BFS
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
BFS //(DFS will take a very long time)
//If the tree is very wide:
DFS //(BFS will need too much memory, has to keep track of nodes)
//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS
//Determining wether a path exists between 2 nodes:
DFS
//Finding the shortest path:
BFS
